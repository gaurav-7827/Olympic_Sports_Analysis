# Olympic Sports Analytics Project

## Project Overview
This project analyzes historical Olympic Games data to uncover trends in participation,
performance, and medal distribution across regions, sports, and time.

The objective of this project is to derive meaningful insights using data analysis
and visualization techniques and present them in an interactive and easy-to-understand format.

## Tools Used
- **Excel** – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), data cleaning, pivot tables
- **SQL** – Advanced querying, joins, aggregations, and insight generation
- **Power BI** – Interactive dashboard creation and data visualization

---

## Dataset
The project uses multiple CSV files related to Olympic Games, athletes, events, sports,
and regions.

⚠️ **Note:**  
Due to GitHub file size limitations (25MB), the complete EDA Excel workbook
(~45MB) has been shared via Google Drive.

The dashboard allows users to explore:
- Medal distribution by country and sport
- Year-wise and season-wise trends
- Top performing regions and sports
- Participation patterns across different Olympics

---

## SQL Analysis
SQL queries were used to:
- Identify dominant regions and sports
- Analyze medal distribution patterns
- Track participation growth and decline
- Study regional impact on overall medal tally
- Perform joins across multiple Olympic datasets

---

## Conclusion
The analysis highlights that certain regions consistently dominate specific sports,
while overall Olympic participation has grown more inclusive over time.
The project demonstrates how data analytics tools like Excel, SQL, and Power BI
can be effectively combined to extract insights from large real-world datasets.
